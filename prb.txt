Problem

Kerala’s smallholder farmers often lack access to personalized, timely agricultural advice. Generic advisories fail to account for local crop choices, weather, soil conditions, or farming practices. Many farmers also don’t maintain records of their activities, which limits learning from past seasons and accessing scheme benefits.

Challenge

Build an AI-powered personal farming assistant that acts like a digital companion for each farmer—understanding their specific context, guiding their actions, and learning over time.

Core Features

1. Farmer & Farm Profiling: Capture key details—location, land size, crop, soil type, irrigation.
2. Conversational Interface: Enable farmers to interact in Malayalam via voice or text.
3. Activity Tracking: Let farmers log events like sowing, irrigation, input use, or pest issues in simple language.
4. Personalized Advisory: Use AI to give proactive, contextual guidance—e.g., “Rain expected, avoid spraying tomorrow,” or “Pest outbreak reported nearby—inspect your brinjal crop.”
5. Reminders & Alerts: Send timely nudges for crop operations, scheme deadlines, and price trends.
6. Knowledge Engine: Pull from local crop calendars, pest data, and best practices to continuously improve recommendations.

Expected Impact

- Empowers farmers with personalized, on-demand support.
- Enhances productivity and sustainability through timely actions.
- Bridges the knowledge gap using AI + local context.

This solution aims to create a “Krishi Sakhi”—a digital friend who walks with the farmer throughout the crop cycle. The fund availability is subject to availability through government sanction.
